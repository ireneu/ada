Sid\\nhrc memo syria aiding libya 030311.docx; hrc memo syria aiding libya 030311.docx\\nCONFIDENTIAL\\nMarch 3, 2011\\nFor: Hillary\\nFrom: Sid\\nRe: Syria aiding Qaddafi\\nThis memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note\\nto Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It\\nseems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides\\nwith unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his\\nstrategic depthâ€”his support both financial and military.\\nI. Report\\nDuring the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan\\nLeader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him\\nagainst the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are\\nbeing supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his\\nson Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,\\nEgypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,\\ntraining, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council\\n(NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Galil have been\\nchosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739546\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the\\nEgyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.\\nThese individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian\\nPresident Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the\\nconversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan\\nAir Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel\\nforces.\\n(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February\\n23, President Assad told General Isam Hallaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,\\nto instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil\\nWar breaks out in the immediate future.)\\nOn March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number\\nof Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of\\nthe Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon\\nagainst insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are\\nconvinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the\\nimmediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for\\nopposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in\\nand around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister\\nMousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent\\nthe implementation of the no fly zone.\\nThe Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a\\nmilitary agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-\\nAssad, in the presence of General Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air\\nForce at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-\\nstanding, close links with Moscow.\\nNote from David Owen, former UK foreign secretary\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739546\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Libyan money\\nhelped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat, the author of an attempted coup d'etat in 1983,\\nto leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.\\nAccording to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second\\nteam of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime\\nwho are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they\\nmet with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan, head of Air Force's Intelligence.\\n(Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi\\nstated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the\\nannouncement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal\\nCourt (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of\\nthe 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head of Gadhafi's personal security detail, the\\nDirector-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the\\nregime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added\\nthat Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)\\nFrom: Lord Owen\\nCody,\\nRealistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and\\nstrafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months\\nthat ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations\\ncontinue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout\\noutside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be\\ndoing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the\\ncities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to\\ngo in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East\\nhaving been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan\\nand Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on\\ndomestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi\\nvictory is possible and needs to be weighed in the balance now when deciding what to do.\\nI'm more worried than I am ready to say publicly.\\nYours\\nDavid\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739546\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.
